# Split Second
 "Split Second" is my entry for the Brackeys 2020.2 Game Jam with the theme of "Rewind."

The Brackeys 2020.2 Game Jam took place between August 1 to August 7, 2020. The goal is to create an entire game from scratch within the given time frame of one week that also fits the given theme (Rewind). Split Second was developed using the Unity Engine. 

If you wish to play the game, you can play it in your browser here: https://seansroom.itch.io/split-second
Alternatively, you may download the file corresponding to your OS in the "Executable" folder of this project and play it that way.

How to Play:

-You get 5 seconds to reach the portal.
-If you don't reach the portal you will create an afterimage that mimics your previous actions.
-The afterimage can push buttons and help you reach the portal.
-Think ahead and plan your moves accordingly.


Controls:

Arrow Keys: Move

Space: Jump

R: Restart

Esc: Pause

Pressing 'R' will not generate an afterimage. You can delete all afterimages by pressing "Restart" in the Pause menu.
